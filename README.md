# AI System Framework (MD Simulation)

This repository demonstrates how the Master Document (MD) framework operates in practice.
The MD is a system for managing AI states, transitions, and product integrity.

## Simulation Examples

### Example 1: Activating a Function
Input:tf(action=expand, tone=neutral, format=essay): [draft notes]

text


Process:
1. System recognizes command → Text Function (TF) activated.
2. ContextLock ensures no unrelated chat bleeds into the function.
3. Output: Expanded essay following the draft sequence.

---

### Example 2: Suspension and Resumption
- Step 1 → User runs TF to expand text.
- Step 2 → User interrupts with: "What is 2+2?"
- Step 3 → System suspends TF temporarily and answers from base state.
- Step 4 → TF resumes when re-issued.

---

### Example 3: Forget Context Command
Input:

forget_context

text

Process:
1. All conversation history cleared.
2. Core framework (MD rules) remains intact.
3. Modes and Functions reset.
